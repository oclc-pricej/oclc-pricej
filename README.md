- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @oclc-pricej, a Principal Software Engineer at [OCLC](https://oclc.org)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in software development, woodworking, and video gaming.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning something, but smart enough to know I won't keep this up to date, so specificity would be my enemy here.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me via email: pricej -AT- oclc.org
